# Decision 002: Authentication Methods for Taly Platform

## Status
**Accepted**

---

## Context

Authentication is a critical component of the Taly platform, ensuring secure access for both salon owners and customers. With multiple use cases requiring varied authentication mechanisms, it is essential to select methods that balance security, scalability, and user convenience.

The following requirements drive this decision:
1. Support for password-based authentication.
2. Social login for seamless user onboarding.
3. Token-based mechanisms for secure API access.
4. Scalability to handle an increasing user base.

---

## Decision

We will implement a hybrid authentication strategy comprising:
1. **Password-Based Authentication**: For traditional email and password login.
2. **Social Authentication**: Leveraging OAuth 2.0 for Google and Facebook logins.
3. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For session management and secure API access.

---

## Rationale

### Why Password-Based Authentication?
- **Familiarity**: Most users are accustomed to creating accounts with email and password.
- **Security**: By using salted hashing (e.g., bcrypt), user credentials are protected.
- **Flexibility**: Allows support for password reset and account recovery workflows.

### Why Social Authentication?
- **Convenience**: Enables quick onboarding for users who prefer Google or Facebook.
- **Trust**: Users often trust social platforms for authentication.
- **Reduced Friction**: Avoids the need for users to remember additional passwords.

### Why JWT?
- **Stateless**: Eliminates the need for server-side session storage, improving scalability.
- **Security**: Ensures secure transmission of user claims with signature verification.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multi-device logins and integrations with third-party APIs.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Session-Based Authentication
- **Pros**:
  - Familiar and widely implemented.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires server-side storage, adding complexity for scaling.
  - Increases load on the backend.

### 2. Passwordless Authentication (e.g., Magic Links)
- **Pros**:
  - Improved user experience, no passwords to remember.
- **Cons**:
  - Less familiar for some users.
  - Increased reliance on email delivery reliability.

### 3. Biometric Authentication
- **Pros**:
  - Enhanced security and user convenience.
- **Cons**:
  - Device-dependent, limiting universal accessibility.
  - Requires additional development effort.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. **Password-Based Authentication**
- **Hashing**: Use bcrypt to securely store passwords.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/auth/register`: Accepts email, name, and password to create an account.
  - `/auth/login`: Verifies credentials and returns a JWT.
  - `/auth/reset-password`: Handles password reset workflows.

### 2. **Social Authentication**
- **OAuth 2.0**:
  - Integrate with Google and Facebook using their respective APIs.
  - Configure client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/auth/google`: Redirects users to Google login.
  - `/auth/facebook`: Redirects users to Facebook login.
- **Token Exchange**:
  - Exchange OAuth tokens for JWTs after successful login.

### 3. **JWT Implementation**
- **Token Structure**:
  - **Header**: Specifies algorithm and token type.
  - **Payload**: Contains user claims (e.g., `userId`, `role`).
  - **Signature**: Ensures token integrity.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/auth/refresh-token`: Issues a new JWT when the old one expires.
- **Expiration**:
  - Access Token: Short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes).
  - Refresh Token: Long-lived (e.g., 7 days).

## Consequences

### Positive Impacts
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Social login reduces onboarding friction.
- **Scalability**: Stateless JWT authentication supports growing user demands.
- **Security**: Strong password hashing and token-based mechanisms mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Potential Challenges
- **Complexity**: Implementing and maintaining OAuth integrations requires additional effort.
- **Token Revocation**: Stateless nature of JWTs complicates immediate revocation.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement token blacklists or short-lived tokens.

---

## Monitoring and Metrics
- **Authentication Success Rate**: Track login success vs. failures.
- **Token Usage**: Monitor token issuance and expiration patterns.
- **OAuth Performance**: Evaluate API call latency and error rates for Google and Facebook integrations.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Explore passwordless options (e.g., magic links) for improved user convenience.
- Add biometric authentication for mobile app users.
- Expand social login to include platforms like LinkedIn and Apple.
