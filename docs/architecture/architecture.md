# Taly Platform Architecture

## Overview

The Taly platform is designed with a modern microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and seamless integration between its various components. This document provides an overview of the architecture, highlighting the key design principles, components, and data flows.

---

## Key Design Principles

### **1. Microservices**

- Each business domain (e.g., authentication, booking, payments) is managed by an independent service.
- Services communicate via asynchronous messaging (event-driven architecture) and REST APIs where necessary.

### **2. Scalability**

- The platform leverages Kubernetes for horizontal scaling to handle varying workloads.
- Stateless services with token-based authentication ensure easy scaling.

### **3. Resilience**

- Built-in retries and circuit breakers to handle transient failures.
- Event-driven patterns ensure services can recover independently.

### **4. Security**

- Follows best practices with OAuth 2.0, JWT, and secure API gateways.
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

## Core Components

### **1. Frontend**

- Built with **Next.js** for server-side rendering and client-side interactivity.
- Separate micro-frontends for dashboards, booking, and payments.

### **2. Backend Services**

#### **Auth Service**

- Handles user authentication (email/password and social logins).
- Issues JWTs for API access.

#### **User Service**

- Manages user profiles, companies, and subscription plans.

#### **Booking Service**

- Manages appointments, availability, and calendar integrations.

#### **Payment Service**

- Processes payments via Stripe and PayPal.
- Tracks financial transactions and issues refunds.

#### **Notification Service**

- Sends email and SMS notifications using Twilio and Amazon SES.

#### **Message Broker**

- RabbitMQ ensures asynchronous communication between services.

### **3. Database Layer**

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for transactional data.
- **Redis**: Caching and session management.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores static assets (e.g., user uploads, receipts).

### **4. Infrastructure**

- **Kubernetes (EKS)**: Orchestrates containerized services.
- **Terraform**: Manages infrastructure as code.
- **Docker**: Containerizes all services for consistency.

## Data Flow

### **1. Booking Workflow**

1. A customer requests an appointment via the booking frontend.
2. The booking service verifies availability and creates a booking record.
3. An event (`booking.created`) is published to RabbitMQ.
4. The notification service listens to the event and sends a confirmation email/SMS.

### **2. Payment Processing**

1. A customer initiates payment through the frontend.
2. The payment service processes the transaction via Stripe/PayPal.
3. On success, a `payment.success` event is published.
4. Relevant services (e.g., booking, analytics) consume the event to update records.

## Communication Patterns

### **1. REST APIs**

- Used for synchronous communication between the frontend and backend.
- Example: Fetching user profiles or creating a new booking.

### **2. Event-Driven Architecture**

- Asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ.
- Ensures decoupled services and resilience.

---

## Deployment

### **Environments**

- **Development**: Local Docker Compose setup for rapid iteration.
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for QA testing.
- **Production**: Hosted on AWS with high availability.

### **CI/CD Pipeline**

- GitHub Actions automates testing, builds, and deployments.
- Terraform ensures consistent infrastructure provisioning.

---

## Monitoring and Observability

### **Tools Used**

- **Prometheus**: Collects system metrics.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and creates alerts.
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

### **Key Metrics**

- API response times and error rates.
- Message broker queue lengths.
- Database query performance.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Analytics**:
   - Build a real-time dashboard for business performance metrics.
2. **AI-Powered Recommendations**:
   - Implement machine learning models for personalized recommendations.
3. **Global Expansion**:
   - Add support for multi-language and multi-currency environments.
