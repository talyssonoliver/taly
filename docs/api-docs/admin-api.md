# Admin API Documentation â€“ Taly CRM (Internal)

This document outlines the internal **Admin API endpoints** used by Taly staff to manage platform-wide data, monitor tenant behaviour, and execute system-level operations. These routes are restricted to users with `SUPER_ADMIN` or `INTERNAL_SERVICE` roles.

> **Important**: These endpoints must never be exposed to client companies or salon users. Access is controlled via special API tokens and environment-based RBAC.

## 2. Authentication

- Requires internal API token (`Authorization: Bearer <internal-admin-token>`)
- Role must be one of:
  - `SUPER_ADMIN`: full admin console access
  - `INTERNAL_SERVICE`: limited access for telemetry/reporting

> Tokens are managed in AWS SSM and rotated manually.
