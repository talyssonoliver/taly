## Deployment Architecture

Taly uses a cloud-native architecture deployed primarily on AWS with:

- **Frontend Applications**: Hosted on Vercel's edge network with global CDN distribution
- **API Services**: Containerized NestJS applications running on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- **Database Layer**: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with read replicas for high-availability
- **Cache Layer**: ElastiCache Redis clusters in multi-AZ configuration
- **Storage**: S3 buckets with appropriate lifecycle policies and access controls
- **Message Broker**: Amazon MQ (managed RabbitMQ) with multi-AZ deployment
- **Serverless Functions**: AWS Lambda with API Gateway triggers and event-based execution

This architecture provides several advantages:
- Geographic distribution for low-latency access
- Horizontal scalability for handling traffic spikes
- High availability with multi-AZ deployments
- Cost optimization through auto-scaling and serverless components
- Security through AWS IAM roles and network isolation

## Environment Configuration

Taly maintains three distinct environments, each with specific purposes and configuration:

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Feature development and testing
- **Infrastructure**: Lightweight configuration using AWS App Runner and RDS small instances
- **Deployment**: Automatic from feature branches with ephemeral preview environments
- **Data**: Anonymized production data subset for realistic testing

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production validation and integration testing
- **Infrastructure**: Mirrors production at reduced scale
- **Deployment**: Manual promotion from development with automated testing gates
- **Data**: Complete anonymized copy of production data refreshed weekly

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live customer-facing services
- **Infrastructure**: Full-scale deployment with redundancy across multiple availability zones
- **Deployment**: Controlled promotion from staging with manual approval steps
- **Data**: Live customer data with comprehensive backup and security measures

Each environment's configuration is managed through:
- Environment-specific Terraform workspaces
- Kubernetes namespaces with RBAC controls
- Parameter Store for environment variables
- Secrets Manager for sensitive credentials
