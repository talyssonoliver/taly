# Deployment Rollback Procedure

## Introduction

This document outlines the steps to perform a rollback of our deployment process when issues arise after a release. A rollback is necessary when we need to revert changes made during a deployment to restore the previous stable version of our application.

## Pre-Rollback Checks

Before initiating a rollback, ensure the following:

1. Identify the specific issue causing the problem
2. Verify the impact of rolling back on users and business processes
3. Confirm the availability of the previous stable version
4. Notify relevant stakeholders about the planned rollback

## Steps for Rolling Back

1. Stop all active deployments and updates
2. Switch to the previous stable branch/tag
3. Deploy the previous stable version
4. Update any configuration files if necessary
5. Test thoroughly to ensure the rollback was successful

## Post-Rollback Actions

After completing the rollback:

1. Monitor the system closely for any remaining issues
2. Document the rollback process and reasons for performing it
3. Review the root cause of the original issue
4. Implement preventive measures for future occurrences

## Communication Plan

Notify affected parties:

- Development team
- Operations team
- Key stakeholders
- End-users (if necessary)

Provide regular updates on the rollback progress and expected timeline for returning to normal operations.

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after the rollback:

1. Review logs for any error messages or anomalies
2. Check system resources and performance metrics
3. Consult with relevant teams for additional insights
4. Consider implementing temporary workarounds while investigating long-term solutions

## Prevention Strategies

To minimize the need for rollbacks in the future:

1. Implement thorough testing procedures
2. Use canary releases or blue-green deployments
3. Regularly update documentation and training materials
4. Conduct regular code reviews and security audits

## Conclusion

Rollbacks are an essential part of our deployment strategy. By having a well-defined rollback procedure, we can quickly respond to issues and maintain system stability.

Remember: Always prioritize user experience and minimize downtime when performing rollbacks.
