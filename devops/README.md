## Key Components

### **1. CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Deployment)**
- **Location**: `ci-cd/`
- **Description**: Contains YAML pipelines for automating builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub Actions.
- **Features**:
  - Backend and frontend build pipelines.
  - Serverless functions deployment.
  - Automated database migrations.
  - Nightly builds for testing and quality assurance.

**Example Workflow**:
```yaml
name: Backend CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm test
      - run: pnpm build
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to AWS
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

### **2. Kubernetes (K8s)**
- **Location**: `k8s/`
- **Description**: Manifests for deploying the Taly microservices to a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Key Files**:
  - `deployments/`: Definitions for pods and replicas.
  - `services/`: Exposes microservices to the network.
  - `ingress.yml`: Configures routing and load balancing.
  - `secrets.yml`: Manages sensitive data.

**Example Deployment Manifest**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: auth-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: auth-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: auth-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: auth-service
        image: taly/auth-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: auth-service-secrets
```

### **3. Terraform**
- **Location**: `terraform/`
- **Description**: Manages cloud infrastructure resources, including databases, storage, and compute instances.
- **Features**:
  - Provision PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS), Redis, and S3 buckets.
  - Create EKS clusters for Kubernetes workloads.
  - Define VPC, subnets, and security groups.

**Example Configuration**:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_rds_instance" "taly_db" {
  allocated_storage    = 20
  engine               = "postgres"
  instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
  name                 = "talydb"
  username             = "admin"
  password             = "securepassword"
  parameter_group_name = "default.postgres12"
  skip_final_snapshot  = true
}
```

### **4. Monitoring**
- **Location**: `monitoring/`
- **Description**: Configurations for tracking system health, performance, and logs.
- **Key Tools**:
  - **Prometheus**: Metric collection and alerting.
  - **Grafana**: Dashboard visualization.
  - **Logstash** and **Kibana**: Log aggregation and analysis.

**Example Prometheus Config**:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'taly-services'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['auth-service:3000', 'user-service:3000']
```

---

### **5. Security**
- **Location**: `security/`
- **Description**: Contains configurations for securing the platform.
- **Features**:
  - OAuth 2.0 configuration for secure authentication.
  - JWT key management.
  - Network policies for Kubernetes.

**Example OAuth Configuration**:
```yaml
client_id: your-client-id
client_secret: your-client-secret
redirect_uris:
  - https://taly.dev/oauth/callback
scopes:
  - openid
  - profile
  - email
```

### **6. Logs**
- **Location**: `logs/`
- **Description**: Centralized log management for debugging and monitoring.
- **Key Tools**:
  - Filebeat for log forwarding.
  - Logstash for processing.
  - Kibana for querying and visualizing logs.

## How to Use

### **Run Infrastructure Locally**
1. **Start Services with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

3. **Provision Cloud Resources with Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
