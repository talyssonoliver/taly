# Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy for the Taly CRM platform, outlining test structures, tools, and execution guidelines.

---

## 1. Testing Strategy

The testing framework consists of the following levels:

### 1.1 Unit Tests

- **Scope**: Validates individual functions and components.
- **Tools**: Jest (Backend & Frontend), Testing Library (React components).
- **Coverage**:
  - Backend: Controllers, services, and utility functions.
  - Frontend: React components, hooks, and helpers.

### 1.2 Integration Tests

- **Scope**: Tests the interaction between modules or services.
- **Tools**: Jest (Backend), Supertest for HTTP endpoints.
- **Coverage**:
  - API interactions.
  - Database operations.
  - Service-to-service communication.

### 1.3 End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Scope**: Validates complete user flows across the system.
- **Tools**: Cypress (Frontend), Jest & Supertest (Backend APIs).
- **Coverage**:
  - Authentication and role-based access.
  - Booking and payment workflows.
  - Notification and confirmation handling.

## 2. Running Tests

### 2.1 Running Unit Tests

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

View coverage reports in `coverage/index.html`.

### 2.2 Running Integration Tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Ensures API endpoints and database operations work correctly.

### 2.3 Running E2E Tests

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

Executes end-to-end tests for full workflow validation.

---

## 3. Test Coverage Goals

To maintain code quality, the following thresholds are enforced:

- **Statements**: 90%
- **Branches**: 85%
- **Functions**: 90%
- **Lines**: 90%

Configured in `jest.config.js`:

```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 90,
    branches: 85,
    functions: 90,
    lines: 90,
  },
},
```

---

## 4. CI/CD Integration

- **GitHub Actions** runs test suites on every PR.
- Fails builds if coverage thresholds are not met.
- Includes automatic rollback strategies in case of failed tests.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Common Issues

1. **Failing Tests**

   - Run tests with `--verbose` flag to debug issues.
   - Check logs for missing dependencies or database connection failures.

2. **Low Coverage**
   - Ensure critical business logic has proper test coverage.
   - Use the `--watch` flag to iteratively develop tests.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Maintaining a robust test suite ensures system reliability and code maintainability. This guide should help developers efficiently execute and improve tests for the Taly CRM platform.
