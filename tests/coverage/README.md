Test Coverage Documentation

Overview

This document provides insights into the test coverage strategy for the Taly CRM platform. It includes details about the tools used, types of tests conducted, and instructions for generating and analyzing coverage reports.

1. Coverage Tools

1.1 Tools Used

Jest: For unit and integration testing.

Cypress: For end-to-end (E2E) testing.

Coverage Reporting:

Istanbul: Integrated with Jest for code coverage reporting.

Cypress Coverage Plugin: For capturing E2E coverage data.

2. Types of Tests

2.1 Unit Tests

Scope: Validates individual functions and components.

Tools: Jest.

Coverage:

Backend services: Controllers, services, and utility functions.

Frontend: React components, hooks, and helpers.

2.2 Integration Tests

Scope: Tests the interaction between modules or services.

Tools: Jest.

Coverage:

API interactions.

Database operations.

Service-to-service communication (e.g., REST API calls).

2.3 End-to-End Tests

Scope: Validates complete user flows across the system.

Tools: Cypress.

Coverage:

User authentication and authorization flows.

Booking creation, update, and cancellation.

Payment processing and notifications.

3. Generating Coverage Reports

3.1 Backend

Navigate to the backend service directory (e.g., auth-service, user-service).

Run the tests with coverage:

npm test -- --coverage

Open the generated coverage report in coverage/index.html.

3.2 Frontend

Navigate to the frontend project directory (e.g., dashboard).

Run the tests with coverage:

npm test -- --coverage

Open the generated coverage report in coverage/index.html.

3.3 End-to-End

Run Cypress tests with the coverage plugin enabled:

npm run cypress:coverage

Merge and analyze the coverage report:

npm run coverage:merge

View the consolidated report in coverage/index.html.

4. Coverage Thresholds

4.1 Global Thresholds

To ensure code quality, the following minimum coverage thresholds are enforced:

Statements: 90%

Branches: 85%

Functions: 90%

Lines: 90%

These thresholds are configured in the jest.config.js file:

coverageThreshold: {
global: {
statements: 90,
branches: 85,
functions: 90,
lines: 90,
},
},

5. Analyzing Coverage Reports

5.1 Coverage Report Structure

Summary Table: Displays the overall coverage percentage for statements, branches, functions, and lines.

Detailed View: Shows file-level and function-level coverage details.

Uncovered Lines: Highlights areas of code that need additional tests.

5.2 Actionable Insights

Identify Coverage Gaps:

Use the detailed view to locate uncovered lines or branches.

Prioritize critical business logic for additional tests.

Refactor Complex Code:

High cyclomatic complexity may indicate areas needing simplification.

Add Tests for Edge Cases:

Cover scenarios such as invalid inputs, exceptions, and boundary conditions.

6. Continuous Integration

6.1 CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions is used to enforce coverage checks:

Runs the test suite on every pull request.

Fails the build if coverage thresholds are not met.

6.2 Coverage Badge

Add a coverage badge to the project README to reflect the current coverage status.

Example:

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-90%25-brightgreen)

7. Troubleshooting

7.1 Common Issues

Low Coverage in Mocked Tests:

Ensure mocks return realistic data.

Avoid over-mocking critical logic.

Coverage Report Not Generated:

Verify the --coverage flag is used when running tests.

Check for proper integration of Istanbul or Cypress coverage plugins.

7.2 Debugging Tips

Use the --verbose flag to debug test failures.

Inspect logs and stack traces for errors in the test setup or execution.

8. Conclusion

Maintaining high test coverage is essential for ensuring the reliability and quality of the Taly CRM platform. This document serves as a guide for generating, analyzing, and improving coverage reports. By adhering to these practices, the development team can identify and address potential issues early, ensuring a robust and maintainable system.
